        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> ModernClean does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All file scanning and processing occurs entirely on your device. We have no access to your files, folders, or any personal information.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>iDevelopment LLC ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and use for our applications, including ModernClean.</p>
        <p>By using our applications, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our applications.</p>

        <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We want to be completely transparent: <strong>we do not collect any personal information from you.</strong> Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identifiers (name, email address, phone number)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or unique device IDs</li>
            <li>Location data or IP addresses</li>
            <li>File names, file contents, or folder structures</li>
            <li>Usage statistics or analytics data</li>
            <li>Browsing history or search queries</li>
            <li>Cookies or tracking technologies</li>
            <li>Any other personal or sensitive information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Our App Works</h2>
        <p>ModernClean is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>
        
        <h3>Local Processing Only</h3>
        <p>All file scanning, duplicate detection, and storage analysis occurs entirely on your Mac. Your files are never uploaded to any server, and we have no ability to access, view, or retrieve any of your data.</p>
        
        <h3>No Network Transmission</h3>
        <p>The app does not transmit any information about your files, folders, or system to external servers. The only network communication that may occur is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In-App Purchase verification through Apple's App Store (handled entirely by Apple)</li>
            <li>Checking for app updates through the Mac App Store (handled entirely by Apple)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Sandboxed Application</h3>
        <p>ModernClean operates within Apple's App Sandbox, meaning it can only access files and folders that you explicitly grant permission to access. This provides an additional layer of security and privacy protection.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>If you choose to make an in-app purchase:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All payment processing is handled exclusively by Apple through the App Store</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID</li>
            <li>We only receive confirmation that a purchase was completed to unlock features</li>
            <li>Purchase records are stored locally on your device and synced through your iCloud account by Apple</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our applications do not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or data collection services. We do not use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics or similar tracking tools</li>
            <li>Facebook SDK or social media trackers</li>
            <li>Advertising networks or ad tracking</li>
            <li>Crash reporting services that collect personal data</li>
            <li>Any third-party SDKs that collect user information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only third-party service used is Apple's StoreKit framework for in-app purchases, which is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--accent-primary);">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Any preferences or settings you configure in the app are stored locally on your device using macOS's standard preferences system. This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never leaves your device</li>
            <li>Is not accessible to us</li>
            <li>Can be deleted by uninstalling the application</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our applications are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, this policy applies equally to all age groups.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any user data on our servers, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through a data breach of our systems. Your data remains on your device, protected by your Mac's built-in security features and any additional security measures you have enabled.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because we do not collect personal data, traditional data subject rights (such as access, correction, or deletion requests) do not apply. However, you maintain full control over:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access permissions:</strong> You can revoke folder access at any time through System Settings > Privacy & Security</li>
            <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored preferences</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase history:</strong> Managed through your Apple ID account</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>Our applications are available worldwide through the Mac App Store. Since we do not collect or transfer any personal data, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns. Users in the European Union, United Kingdom, California, and other jurisdictions with specific privacy laws can use our applications with confidence that their privacy rights are respected.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>Post the updated policy on this page</li>
            <li>If required by law, notify users through the app or other means</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
